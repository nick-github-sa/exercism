# Exercism Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) exercises.  
The purpose of this repo is to track my progress and practice different programming languages.  

## 📂 Structure
Exercises are organized by language and exercise name, for example:

python/
lasagna/
hello-world/
bash/
two-fer/


## ⚠️ Note
These are **my own solutions** and may not be the most optimal or idiomatic ones.  
If you’re working on Exercism yourself, I encourage you to **try solving the exercises on your own first** before looking at other solutions.  

## 📝 License
Exercises are originally provided by Exercism under the MIT license.  
My solutions are also shared freely under the MIT license.
